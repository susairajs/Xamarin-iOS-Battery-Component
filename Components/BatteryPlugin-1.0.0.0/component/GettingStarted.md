# Getting Started with Battery Plugin



### API Usage

Call **CrossBattery.Current** from any project or PCL to gain access to APIs.


**RemainingChargePercent**
```
/// <summary>
/// Current battery level 0 - 100
/// </summary>
int RemainingChargePercent { get; }
```

**Status**
```
/// <summary>
/// Current status of the battery
/// </summary>
BatteryStatus Status { get; }
```

This returns an enum with the current status of the battery. If charging or not:

```
/// <summary>
/// Current status of battery
/// </summary>
public enum BatteryStatus
{
  /// <summary>
  /// Plugged in and charging
  /// </summary>
  Charging,
  /// <summary>
  /// Battery is being drained currently
  /// </summary>
  Discharging,
  /// <summary>
  /// Battery is full completely
  /// </summary>
  Full,
  /// <summary>
  /// Not charging, but not discharging either
  /// </summary>
  NotCharging,
  /// <summary>
  /// Unknown or other status
  /// </summary>
  Unknown

}
```

Important:
* iOS: only returns Charging, Full, Discharging, and Unknown.
* WP: only returns Charging, Full, Discharging
* WP 8.1 RT: calculats charge/full and starts with unknown status


**PowerSource**
```
/// <summary>
/// Currenlty how the battery is being charged.
/// </summary>
PowerSource PowerSource { get; }
```

Returns how the phone is being charged

#### Events

You can subscribe to BatteryChanged, which will return BatteryChangedEventArgs with all information you need.
This occurs when plugged, unplugged, or battery change.

```
/// <summary>
/// Event handler when battery changes
/// </summary>
event BatteryChangedEventHandler BatteryChanged;
```

Note: on WP you will only receive this on battery level change.
